# Task-Scheduler
The project includes a multithreaded task scheduler that manages asynchronous execution of tasks using worker threads. Tasks are submitted to a shared queue and executed concurrently by available threads, allowing the program to perform background operations without blocking the main execution flow.
This design improves responsiveness and enables parallel processing of independent tasks.
